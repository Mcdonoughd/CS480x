Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3

When one thinks of graphical primitives, it is easy to think of the basic PlayStation symbols. With this mindset I've made my own envisioning of the PlayStation 5 Launch/Start Up screen.

This site uses primitives Lines (Paths), Triangles (Polygons), Crosses (Symbols), and Circles and Rectangles (Shapes).
