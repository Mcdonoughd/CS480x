	<p>We have outlined our Process Book henceforth. It has been organized to give readers a comprehensive chronological
		summary of the decisions and experiments we undertook, along with outlining the errors we made along the way and any
		modifications to the original proposal.</p>
	<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>
	<p>For our project, we have made use of a very interesting hierarchical means of representation- practical application
		of the circle packing algorithm to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing">Circle
			Packing</a> graph, a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping">TreeMap</a> means of
		representation. This family of graphs excels at visualizing hierarchical data, and we sought to apply these
		principles to showing the disparity in 6 categories of water use throughout the 3,412 counties in the United States.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h3 id="inspirationpast-papers">Inspiration/Past Papers</h3>
	<p>We chose the circle packing graph to represent our data for a few reasons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>After we manipulated the dataset, cleaned it, and added new columns corresponding to region types in the USA
				(New England, etc.) we realized it became very nested and we needed a graph type that would be able to handle
				this level of nesting without sacrificing readibility.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>We were able to combine the distribution of a county's individual water use across the categories specified in
				the dataset to be presented as an <code>onhover</code> interaction when they hover over a particular county's
				value. Because of this, the user can interact with and visualize the hierarchy while not losing sight over
				individual objects easily.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>We researched for the most effective visualizations for highly nested datasets like ours. Immediate results
				that came up were to use a Tree Map or similar graph. However, reading <a
					href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772102000998">Collins et al.</a> helped us gain a
				very strong familiarity with the underlying mechanics of a circle packing graph. When trying to design a
				visualization using the algorithm however, we read <a
					href="http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1130000/1124851/p517-wang.pdf?ip=130.215.216.106&amp;id=1124851&amp;acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&amp;key=7777116298C9657D%2E71E5F5E88B9A3E17%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&amp;__acm__=1551327706_556ef29cade2baf4e5e8f8c2306c90de">Dai
					et al.</a> a CHI 2006 paper that described various methods of encoding the circle packing and how to design a
				scaling function that wouldn't be unproportional to the data being represented.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
	<p>We chose the subject of water use because of how fresh water is a dwindling resource- <a
			href="https://qz.com/319919/these-are-the-places-on-earth-where-wine-and-beer-are-cheaper-than-water/">this</a>
		article talks about how in countries like New Zealand, Germany, Australia, and the Czech Republic, just to name a
		few, water is more expensive than wine or beer. As scientists, we believe that this disparity is ridiculous given
		how all of these countries are all either G6 or G7 countries, considered to be &quot;developed&quot;. Water should
		be a freely accessible resource that is regulated and whose infrastructure is developed by the people to generate a
		public supply system. The United States employs a similar system, having created a public supply water system that
		is centralized to every state.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3 id="data-source">Data Source</h3>
	<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/get/5af3311be4b0da30c1b245d8">USGS dataset</a> that we are
		using for this project consists of 140+ individual attributes corresponding to a particular county's water
		consumption across various sectors. We employed the power of the Pandas module in Python 3 to reduce the
		dimensionality of this dataset to correspond to particular interests of ours. For this project, we were interested
		in comparing the distribution of water consumption across the 6 sectors mentioned in the dataset. They are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Public Supply (government supplies water for personal and home use/bathrooms)</li>
		<li>Domestic Supply (citizen supplies own water for personal and home use/bathrooms)</li>
		<li>Industrial Supply (for factories, other large scale operations)</li>
		<li>Livestock Supply (water going directly towards hydrating livestock)</li>
		<li>Irrigation Supply (going directly for irrigation of farms and homesteads)</li>
		<li>Thermoelectric Supply (Water generated as a byproduct of electric generation and is used for non-human related
			activities)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We computed values for each of these sectors given the much more specific data provided in the dataset. This was
		done through the synthesis of each specific attribute for a sector.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3 id="initial-exploration">Initial Exploration</h3>
	<p>Initial exploration was conducted upon two major things; the graph type and the dataset.
		We experimted with the principles of a circle packing graph to identify key factors that would help in our specific
		situation. For example, one of the adjustments we made was that a user cannot see the entire hierarchy from the
		start; they interact with the visualization to reveal only the contents of that <code>depth</code>. This depth was a
		feature of d3.js that we really edited for this project. We wanted to work with the <code>depth</code> variable to
		layer it such that you weren't presented with the 3000+ circles representing each county. We realized that having
		this view would be utterly confusing and not communicate the data at all. It would instead just clog up the visual
		space with all of the circles and a lack of understanding what each meant. So, we did it such that you can only see
		the circle of the current depth of the tree you're in. It's an interesting design philosophy as we were reading
		papers mentioned earlier on the design of well done circle packing graphs and the ideology of showing only the
		contents of a certain node's depth was mentioned as techniques for efficient communication given large datasets.</p>
	<p>Screenshots are to come but basically we originated with a Tree Map that corresponded to the data as a sort of
		&quot;test&quot; in the tree-based hierarchy visualizations. This evolved into an unlabeled circle packing graph to
		an interactive, multi-tier one with our model of depth based perception.</p>
	<p>Here's a very initial exploration into our dataset that helped us readjust our perceptions.</p>
	<h4 id="initial-treemap-construction">Initial Treemap Construction</h4>
	<p>Since we knew that circle packing graphs were subsets of treemaps, we wanted to see what a treemap of our dataset
		would look like. Here's the catastrophe that resulted:
		<img
			src="https://svadivazhagu.github.io/final/img/treemap.PNG"
			alt="0"></p>
	<p><br>Data was just being presented everywhere, with there being way too many points shown in the top level view. We
		noticed this with other visualizations too, how they had implemented circle packing graphs or other hierarchical
		means of visualization but had shown every single unit in an interactive manner from the root node. That just
		overwhelmed us. We made the conscious decision here that in our circle packing graph, we would only show the current
		depths' contents, and provide the interactivity to access deeper or go higher up. This level of interactivity makes
		the hierarchy easier to understand and navigate, and reduces the level of visual clutter present in our treemap.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4 id="initial-treemap-construction">t-SNE Implementation</h4>
		<p>In class, we have talked about other types of agglomerative clustering such as t-sne and its dementionality reduction ability.
			Our initial thoughts were that it would work very well considering the numerous feilds and categories of water usage in our dataset. This is what resulted:
			<img
				src="./img/tsne.png"
				alt="tsne__image"></p>
		<p><br>Although it does do its job and clusters points close to each other spacially. But not only is it increadibly
			slow, but there is no useful knowledge or data that can be derived from this with out more knowledge from other datasets. We can inference that
		districts and counties that use more water are more likely to use it based on the main area of work (agricultiral...) around the state.</p>
			<hr>
	<hr>
	<h3 id="evolution-of-concept">Evolution of Concept</h3>
	<p>Rather than elaborate purely in text about our design choices, here are some images captured throughout the
		developement with explanations of our perspective at that point.</p>
	<p><img
			src="https://svadivazhagu.github.io/final/img/1.png"
			alt="1"> <br>This was when we were first able to load the dataset into the frontend to manipulate. We exported a
		JSON object from the Pandas dataframe for use in creating the circle pack visualization.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><img
			src="https://svadivazhagu.github.io/final/img/2.png"
			alt="2"></p>
	<p><br> Then we drew a circle in d3 to start placing data on the circle pack. We were having some issues with
		designing the hierarchy within the dataset to make sense with what was needed to set up the circle pack, and were
		getting some errors.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><img
			src="https://svadivazhagu.github.io/final/img/2.5.png"
			alt="3">
		<br> Shortly after being able to load the dataset in and show it visually, we were able to create a very basic
		circle packing visualization. This iteration of the project had no interactivity whatsoever, and presented all 3000+
		datapoints from the top-level view. This had to go.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><img
			src="https://svadivazhagu.github.io/final/img/4.png"
			alt="4">
		<br> Choosing a proper colorscale was also of importance to us. We selected this 6 class color scheme to be the pie
		chart's color scheme once we got to that step.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><img
			src="https://svadivazhagu.github.io/final/img/5.png"
			alt="5">
		<br> The next big update. This vis has the circle pack done and the initial pie chart working. The issue was with
		the labels. They really got in the way of seeing what the data represented. We realized it would be best to rename
		the attributes and use the pie chart on the right as a legend. Also, the rendering was ridiculously slow. We ran
		various benchmarks like Google Lighthouse on the site to get a more comprehensive understanding of what was causing
		the bottleneck. It was found that the lag was being caused by how whenever a user clicked in or out of a
		<code>depth</code> it would redraw the entire graph instead of just the area they were going into. This was a major
		red flag for the high latency and we prioritized redesigning the rendering system such that it would only load what
		was in the current depth.</p>
	<p><img
			src="https://svadivazhagu.github.io/final/img/6.png"
			alt="6">
		<br> This is getting pretty close to wrapping up. However, one of the issues we had was the coloring of
		<code>domestic</code> attribute for domestic water consumption was too similar to the coloring of the circle around
		it. Thus, it was decided to change the coloring of domestic to a more green shade so it would be uniquely
		represented. The rendering is significantly faster due to optimizations in what items are being drawn at what
		depths.</p>
	<p><img
			src="https://svadivazhagu.github.io/final/img/7.PNG"
			alt="7">
		<br> This is the final product. We removed the attribute names in the graph, it was just placed in such a poor
		fashion we gave up that direction and associated the words with their respective colors in the legend. Furthermore,
		the performance was optimized further leading it to run quite smoothly despite having to access a dataset with over
		3000 data points. Also, we added a search functionality that allows a user to search for any <em>region, state, or
			county</em> and navigate to that particular circle.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3 id="our-implementation">Our Implementation</h3>
	<p>Our implementation of the circle packing graph was novel in that our approach to using the <code>depth</code>
		component for the purposes of faster loading and better representation/interaction with the data. We designed this
		approach because of the size of our dataset making the visualization absolutely massive in regards to the overall
		tree depth. The graph was loading really slowly as it had to redraw every single circle when a region was clicked
		on, however when we lifted this instantiation to a more sequential level, only loading the circles inside a clicked
		circle's &quot;children&quot;. This approach allows for readers to have a more interactive experience. Also, we
		added more statistics for individual county visualization by adding a pie chart corresponding to the distribution of
		each sector's water consumption in regards to the county's overall water consumption records across those 6 sectors.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h3 id="evaluation-next-steps">Evaluation &amp; Next Steps</h3>
	<p>However, one interesting takeaway is an understanding about how to represent data given its record. Some datasets
		are incredibly nested and require a treemap in order to be visualized at all. You need to actually display that
		hierarchy; its a feature of your dataset and is a really interesting tool to explore. Seeing how a tree can be
		visualized, whether using a circle packing graph or other means of representation teaches you a lot about the
		dynamics of a hierarchy and how we can best understand these large collections of connected information and how it
		all fits together.
		The search function is really nice to use as it allows people to access a particular depth right off the bat instead
		of having to navigate around for it.
		The combination of the pie charts to show the distribution of water consumption for that county was a bold choice as
		it had been shown previously in papers that pie charts are not effective tools for visual communication, however
		given the limited space of a circle, we feel that it is a useful approach as the distribution is shown through the
		pie chart, and for this particular distribution, the individual values matter less, but their relative proportion in
		regards to the other values is what is important. Pie charts can show this distribution and as such we chose to use
		them. It allowed us to resize each of the circle to be based on population- allowing for even another level of
		insight. Users can view</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Distribution of water use</li>
		<li>Relative population</li>
		<li>the hierarchy and relationship between different geographical locations in the USA.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Because of these reasons, we believe our use of the pie chart is successful for this particular use case.</p>
	<p>Next steps for this project definitely include getting more insights into the water consumption of humans- after
		learning about facets and multi-tiered visualizations it would be really interesting to break down by county per
		capita which counties make use of water well and which don't.</p>
