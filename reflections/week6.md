# Reflection: Pokemon Dashboard

[Pokemon Dashboard](http://jkunst.com/flexdashboard-highcharter-examples/pokemon/)

Looking at another pokemon visualization, this one only looks at the type distrobution of the pokemon. Beyond the standard boring barchart of the primary type distrobution this viz also uses a tree map to show the primary and sub types. This is a unique way to use a tree map and is a great visualization that shows the distrobution of types beyond just the primary types. Another great, unique view of the type distrobution is the use of t-SNE to show the pokemon sprites and organize them into a 2D viz showing the groupings of pokemon types. As cool as the implimentation is, it doesnot say how many iterations or parameters of t-SNE it ran on as the final result is static. in addition, it doesnt make sense at the relationship is hard to read with so many dimentions (18). For example, there are 2 groupings for grass type pokemon, and pokemon with the same typing are in different geospacial locations making it very difficult to analyze. Another gripe i have with this viz is that when you interact with one viz it does not chage the perspective on the other graphs.
