# Reflection: Animating Uncertainty

[Animating Uncertainty](http://vallandingham.me/animating_uncertainty.html)

When visualizing uncertainty, one typically thinks of a variance bar on a line graph or bar chart. This post describes other possible ways of showing variance or uncertainty in a visualization, and when to use them. Notable ones include:

 - HOP Plot and Onion Hop Plot, are animations used for Quantitative data that "hop" through the rang of uncertainty.
 - Morphing Icons: are animations for categorical data. The icons are on screen for relative amount of time in respect to the size of the certainty.
 - Wandering Dots & Bounded Wandering Dots: made for Spacial data. Where each dot is an "event" the travel radius from the relative center is correlated to the uncertainty

Generally, these methods are highly exploratory and still need refinement as it is hard for myself (and possibly) others to collect data for a visualization using these methods. For example, Morphing Icons' use of time seems like a good idea but requires to reader to sit and stare at the icon until it changes and measure the time in their head (which is not accurate). Having the reader be required to stop and stare at a visualization for a defined time rather than a natural reading time is not a good idea. Additionally, Wandering Dots is very good showing the differences at extremes but as shown in class people have difficulty differentiating between small size differences. HOP Plots seem to be the best of the ones shown, however the timing of the animations were not smooth and seemed to "jump" around. The trailing effect of the Fast Onion Hop seemed to be the most effective.
