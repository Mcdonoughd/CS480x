# Reflection: How long Animals Live

[ How long Animals Live](https://www.britannica.com/media/full/topic/340297/147299)

This info graphic diverges from the standard scatter plot, or bar graph but instead uses a semi linear display to show the difference between longevity between animals. Here the curved axis is showed From 0 to 150 years. Each time the line curves back to the same side is 20 years. Each data point is represented by not only the name of the animal but also an icon of the animal in the color representing the type of animal. Overall, this info-graphic is very clean to the eyes for a quick glance but lacks interactivity and causes some inconsistencies when analyzing some comparisons. For example, the icons for the animals are so condensed and large on the first 100 years it causes the lines to get longer along the Y axis than compared to the Y axis for the last 50 years. This causes spacial inconsistencies when reading the data making the animals who live longer seem to live a bit less or make it not as impressive. Following comparisons it is impossible due to the lack of interactivity to section the data by Animal type. This would be much better as a web application. However looks great on a quick glance like who info-graphics are made for.
