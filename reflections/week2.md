# Reflection: Visualizing World Happiness

[Visualizing world happiness](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-01-21_world_happiness/)

Using a Beeswarm plot, Rebecca Barter mapped color to the "Happiness index" of several countries, and size of circles to the population size of the respected country. These attributes stay constant through different organizations of the countries. This method works particularly well for analyzing correlation between all country's happiness, and some other selectable parameter. The viewer is instantly able to pick up trends between the variance and trends of the color space and where they meet in relation to the x-axis. This may be potentially misleading however as a viewer may compare the amount of one color to one side of the screen to an amount of color to another side of the screen, which can get confusing as the sizes of the countries vary by population. For example, the size of china's dot on the graph is huge, possibly causing higher confidants in correlation based on it's positions.

This fails however when one tries to compare two countries or search for a specific county. As most of the smaller countries look the same on the graph, it is hard to differentiate between two just by looking at the data. One has to hover over each datapoint in hopes that the one they are searching for will be the one they are interacting with. And when a user switches to a different parameter they have to research for that country again.


TLDR; Good for quick analyzing trends. Bad for comparisons between countries.
